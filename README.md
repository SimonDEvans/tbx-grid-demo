# Simple tooling

This is a lighter version of the [DIBB](https://github.com/torchbox/design-in-browser-bootstrap), using the same tooling but without Pattern Lab.

## What's required

It is assumed the developer's computer is running OSX or Linux. Depending on your setup you may already have the below installed;

* [Node.js](http://nodejs.org) (version 4.x.x)
* Optional: [Yarn](https://yarnpkg.com/en/docs/install)

## What's included

* [SASS](http://sass-lang.com/) CSS with [auto-prefixing](https://github.com/postcss/autoprefixer).
* [Browsersync](https://www.browsersync.io) for autoreloading.
* [Rollup](https://rollupjs.org) and [Babel](https://babeljs.io) for ES2015 support with module loading.
* Rollup plugins (`rollup.config.js`):
  * eslint
  * uglifyjs with sourcemaps (disabled by default)
  * support for using any installed node modules on the webiste
  * display file size information
* Consideration for images, currently copying the directory only - to avoid slowdowns and non-essential dependancies. We encourage using SVG for UI vectors and pre-optimised UI photograph assets.
* An automated way to upload your site to a staging server using [dploy](https://github.com/LeanMeanFightingMachine/dploy).
* [Build commands](#build-scripts) for generating testable or deployable assets only

## Installation

To start a prototype using this bootstrap;

* **Get the files:** Clone this repository to a new directory, for example 
`git clone https://github.com/SimonDEvans/simple-tooling.git new-project`.
* **Name the project:** Open `package.json` and replace the `name` with your project name [following npm guidelines](http://browsenpm.org/package.json#name).
* **Setup git**: Run `npm run git:init` in the root of your new project to remove existing git links with this repository and create a fresh project with the directory as is committed.
* **Install dependencies** Run `yarn install` to run the install process. `npm install` will work too, see [section about yarn below](#using-yarn).


## Developing with it

* To start the development environment, run `yarn start`, or alternatively `npm start` - to stop this process press `ctrl + c`.
* This will start Browsersync and make the project available at `http://localhost:3000/html/`. If another process is using this port, check terminal for an updated URL. You can change this configuation by modifying the `browsersync.config.js` file, documented here https://www.browsersync.io/docs/options.
* Source files for developing your project are in `src` and the distribution folder for the compiled assets is `dist`. Any changes made to files in the `dist` directory will be overwritten.

### Using yarn

* Yarn is the recommended way to install and upgrade node modules. It's like npm but [handles dependencies better](http://stackoverflow.com/questions/40057469/what-is-the-difference-between-yarn-lock-and-npm-shrinkwrap#answer-40057535).
* Install yarn itself: https://yarnpkg.com/en/docs/install
* Install all packages from `package.json`: `yarn install`
* Add new packages with yarn: `yarn add --dev package_name` (this will add it to `package.json` and `yarn.lock` too)
* Upgrade packages: `yarn upgrade-interactive`
* Keep using `npm` for running npm scripts. Although `yarn run` seems to work as well but `npm-run-all` might not use yarn, so stick to `npm run` for now.


## Deploying it

### Deploy script

You can take advantage of the nodejs package [dploy](https://github.com/LeanMeanFightingMachine/dploy) to upload the `/dist` directory. To do so you will need to;

 * Make a copy of `example.dploy.yaml` and name it `dploy.yaml`.
 * Modify the `host` `user` and `path.remote` variables.
 * Run `npm run deploy` to start the deployment process.

### Build scripts

To only build assets for either development or production you can use

 * `npm run build` To build development assets
 * `npm run build:prod` To build assets with minification and vendor prefixes

### Debug script

To test production, minified and vendor prefixed assets you can use

 * `npm run debug` To develop with a simple http server, no browsersync and production assets
